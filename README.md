This repository serves as a backup for the G-DataLabs project, created during my tenure at ConceptZI. As the project's creator, I've taken the initiative to back up its contents before transferring ownership of the main repository.

The G-DataLabs project is live and accessible at https://ai.g-datalabs.com/

This backup repository ensures the preservation of the project's codebase and associated resources. It serves as a reference point for any future needs, whether it be revisiting implemented features, seeking assistance, or providing examples of my work to recruiters.

By maintaining this backup, I can readily access and review the project's history, enabling me to address any future inquiries or showcase specific features to potential employers.
